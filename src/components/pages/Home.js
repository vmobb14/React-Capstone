          Welcome to my React.js capstone program. My name is Tyler Gilroy, and
          this project bears the results of my blood, sweat, and MANY MANY
          tears. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But seven months prior to my
          creation of this website, I had exactly zero knowledge of software
          development. Now I can build projects such as this, on my own of my
          own ability and knowledge.
